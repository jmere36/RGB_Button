# RGB_Button

Created By: Jmere36

Purpose: To change the colour of an led or more from Red to Green to Blue by a push of a button

Instead of turning on when button is realeased it turns on when button is pressed

Removes the flicker of holding the button as well

This can add many functionalities to your build including: changing a acrylic light stand between r,g,b and potentialy more in future updates

You can also monitor what colour the the led is at in the serial monitor 

If there's any issues or questions please contact my email at: jmere36@icloud.com
